/**
 * @enum code

 * - `eof`: Signifies the end of a file (EOF).
 * - `eos`: Represents the end of a stream, string, statement, or status.
 * - `null_ptr`: Indicates a null or invalid pointer reference.
 * - `notexist`: Indicates that an entity does not exist.
 * - `exist`: Represents that an entity already exists.
 * - `unexpected`: Denotes an unexpected condition.
 * - `expected`: Represents an expected condition.
 * - `blocked`: Indicates that a thread was blocked due to a locked mutex or resource.
 * - `locked`: Represents that a thread has successfully locked a mutex or resource.
 * - `overflow`: Indicates a buffer overflow condition.
 * - `oob`: Represents a buffer overflow, often due to out-of-bounds access.
 * - `reimplement`: Suggests reimplementation of a feature or functionality.
 * - `done`: Indicates the completion of an operation.
 * - `complete`: Represents that a task or process has been fully completed.
 * - `finish`: Marks the concluxion of an operation or process.
 * - `undefined`: Denotes an undefined state or value.
 * - `ready`: Indicates readiness for action or operation.
 * - `terminate`: Represents a termination condition or request.
 * - `timeout`: Denotes that an operation timed out.

 * - `cancel`: Denotes a cancellation event or state.
 * - `object_ptr`: Refers to an object pointer.
 * - `object_id`: Refers to an object identifier.
 * - `unhandled`: Represents an unhandled condition or exception.

 * - `hup`: Indicates a hang-up (HUP) signal or similar condition.
 * - `notready`: Denotes an entity is not yet ready.
 * - `notfound`: Represents that a requested entity or resource was not found.
 * - `found`: Indicates that a requested entity or resource was found.
 * - `dismissed`: Denotes that a condition or state was dismissed.
 * - `syntax_error`: Represents a syntax error condition.
